# CAPSTONE-PROJECT_SOCK-SHOP
Deployment of Socks Shop Microservices-based Application on Kubernetes using IaC and DevOps best practices.
Project Overview:
The Socks Shop application is a popular microservices-based e-commerce platform that is used as a reference application for demonstrating modern cloud-native technologies. The application is composed of multiple microservices, each of which is responsible for a specific function, such as product catalog, shopping cart, and user authentication. The application is designed to be highly scalable, resilient, and fault-tolerant, making it an ideal candidate for deployment on Kubernetes.

The project will involve deploying the Socks Shop application on a Kubernetes cluster using an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approach. This will include provisioning the necessary infrastructure resources on AWS, setting up a deployment pipeline, monitoring the performance and health of the application, and securing the infrastructure.

The project will be implemented using Terraform for infrastructure provisioning, GitHub Actions for the deployment pipeline, Kubernetes for container orchestration, Helm for package management, Prometheus for monitoring, ELK Stack for logging, and Ansible for security.

Prerequisites:
The following tools and technologies will be used in the project:

Terraform: Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool that provides a consistent CLI workflow to manage hundreds of cloud services. It codifies APIs into declarative configuration files, creating infrastructure as code using a high-level configuration language called HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language).

AWS Account: An AWS account will be required to provision the necessary infrastructure resources, such as VPCs, subnets, security groups, and EKS cluster.

GitHub Actions: GitHub Actions will be used to set up a deployment pipeline to build and deploy the Socks Shop application to the Kubernetes cluster.

Kubernetes: Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

Helm: Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that provides an easy way to find, share, and use software built for Kubernetes.

Prometheus: Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for reliability and scalability. It collects metrics from configured targets at given intervals, evaluates rule expressions, displays the results, and can trigger alerts if some condition is observed to be true.

ELK Stack: The ELK Stack is a collection of three open-source products — Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana — all developed, managed, and maintained by Elastic. The ELK Stack is used to collect, search, analyze, and visualize log data in real time.

Let's Encrypt: Let's Encrypt is a free, automated, and open certificate authority brought to you by the nonprofit Internet Security Research Group (ISRG).

Docker: Docker is a set of platform as a service (PaaS) products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.

Socks Shop Application: The Socks Shop application is a popular microservices-based e-commerce platform that is used as a reference application for demonstrating modern cloud-native technologies.
Project Objectives:
The main objectives of the project are as follows:

Deploy the Socks Shop application on a Kubernetes cluster using an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approach
Provision the necessary infrastructure resources on AWS, including VPCs, subnets, security groups, and EKS cluster
Set up a deployment pipeline using GitHub Actions to build and deploy the Socks Shop application to the Kubernetes cluster
Monitor the performance and health of the Socks Shop application using Prometheus
Collect and analyze logs from the Socks Shop application using a centralized logging solution, such as ELK stack.
